# cwd = the harness case workspace, BEFORE the refine/review steps.
#
# The harness symlinks .claude/skills and .context from the project root into each
# case workspace. The strat skills' bootstrap WRITES into those (installs the
# strat-scorer agent, copies assess-strat), so we replace the symlinks with real
# copies/dirs to keep writes inside the throwaway workspace (never back into the repo).
# Then we stage strategy-create's mechanical output (the create->refine handoff) so
# `refine` and `review` run exactly like the prod strat-pipeline.
#
# Assets (assess-strat + architecture-context) are staged into eval/.assets by the
# before_all hook (eval/scripts/stage-assets.sh). Fully offline: --dry-run in the step
# args skips Jira; assess-strat + architecture-context are local.
