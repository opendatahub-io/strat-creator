# Strat Creator

Skills for creating, refining, and reviewing strategy documents from approved RFEs.

## Artifact Conventions

All skills read from and write to the `artifacts/` directory.

```
artifacts/                      # CI pipeline output (gitignored)
  strat-tasks/                    # Strategy files with YAML frontmatter
    STRAT-001.md
    RHAISTRAT-400.md
  strat-reviews/                  # Per-strategy review files with YAML frontmatter
    STRAT-001-review.md
    RHAISTRAT-400-review.md
  strat-originals/                # Original RFE snapshots at time of strategy creation
    RHAIRFE-1595.md
  strat-tickets.md                # RHAISTRAT ticket mapping after cloning

local/                          # Human review workspace (gitignored, mirrors artifacts/ structure)
  strat-tasks/                    # Pulled strategy files (workflow: local)
  strat-reviews/                  # Pulled/generated review files
  strat-originals/                # RFE context for pulled strategies
```

### Frontmatter

All task and review files use YAML frontmatter for structured metadata. Skills must use `scripts/frontmatter.py` to read schemas, set fields, and read validated data — never write YAML by hand.

```bash
# Get schema for a file type
python3 scripts/frontmatter.py schema strat-task
python3 scripts/frontmatter.py schema strat-review

# Set/update frontmatter on a file
python3 scripts/frontmatter.py set <path> field=value field=value ...

# Read validated frontmatter as JSON
python3 scripts/frontmatter.py read <path>
```

### State Persistence

Long-running skills use `scripts/state.py` to persist state to `tmp/` files so it survives context compression.

```bash
python3 scripts/state.py init <file> key=value ...
python3 scripts/state.py set <file> key=value ...
python3 scripts/state.py set-default <file> key=value ...
python3 scripts/state.py read <file>
python3 scripts/state.py write-ids <file> ID ...
python3 scripts/state.py read-ids <file>
python3 scripts/state.py timestamp
python3 scripts/state.py clean
```

### File Naming

- **Cloned from Jira**: Use Jira key as filename (e.g., `RHAISTRAT-400.md`)
- **Local pre-submission**: Use `STRAT-NNN.md` naming
- **On submit**: `STRAT-NNN.md` files are renamed to `RHAISTRAT-NNNN.md`

## Pipeline Gates

Gate logic (label checks, skip conditions) is duplicated across all three skills: `strategy-create`, `strategy-refine`, and `strategy-review`. When changing a gate, update all three skills to keep them consistent.

## Jira Integration

### Read Operations

Read operations support two modes:

1. **Atlassian MCP server** (preferred when available)
2. **REST API fallback** via `python3 scripts/fetch_issue.py` using `JIRA_SERVER`/`JIRA_USER`/`JIRA_TOKEN` env vars

### Write Operations

Not yet implemented for strat-creator. Strategy submission to Jira will be added as a future skill.

## Jira Field Mappings

### RHAISTRAT Project
- **Project**: `RHAISTRAT`
- **Issue Type**: `Feature`
- **Clone link type**: `Cloners` (outward: "clones", inward: "is cloned by")
- **Related link type**: `Related`

### RHAIRFE Project (source — read only)
- **Project**: `RHAIRFE`
- **Issue Type**: `Feature Request`

## Testing

After every code change, run the test suite in a background subagent before reporting the change as complete. Use `make test-unit` for changes to scripts or library code. Use `make test` to run all tests when integration/E2E tests are also relevant. Never skip this step — a change is not done until tests pass.

**Always run `make test` (full suite including integration tests) before pushing to remote.** Unit tests alone are not sufficient — the jira-emulator integration tests catch issues that unit tests miss.

## Architecture Context

Strategy skills fetch architecture context from opendatahub-io/architecture-context into `.context/architecture-context/`. Used during refinement and review to ground feedback in real platform architecture.

```bash
# Fetch from remote (default)
bash scripts/fetch-architecture-context.sh

# Use a local checkout (e.g., to test overlays before pushing)
bash scripts/fetch-architecture-context.sh /path/to/local/architecture-context
```

When a local path is provided, the script copies the local architecture context into `.context/architecture-context/` instead of cloning from remote. This lets staff engineers test overlay changes locally before pushing upstream.

### Architecture Context Overlays

Overlays are cross-strategy architectural patches that live in the `overlays/` directory of the architecture-context repo. They capture facts that emerged between architecture context regeneration cycles (version bumps, maturity changes, dependency shifts). The fetch script includes `overlays/` in the sparse checkout automatically.

See the [Overlays README](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/architecture-context/blob/main/overlays/README.md) for the format and lifecycle.

## Eval Dataset Anonymization

Files under `eval/dataset/` are built by `eval/scripts/build_dataset.py` from real RHAIRFE→RHAISTRAT triples and **must be anonymized** before they are committed or shared (they are git-ignored precisely because the raw build contains internal content). Never include real customer/partner names, individual names, email addresses, internal Slack / Google Docs / Miro / workshop links, or other personally identifiable or confidential information.

Replace each with a fictional equivalent, and **web-search every replacement** to confirm it does not match a real entity — a placeholder that collides with a real company or person is not anonymized (e.g. "Meridian Bank" → "Cobalt National Bank" only after verifying the latter is fictional). Also web-search the original to confirm it is real before replacing. This applies to test inputs, annotations, and all reference files. Keep names consistent across files (same real entity → same fictional entity; derive handles/nicknames from the person's new name).

**Kept as-is (not PII):** Red Hat and its products, upstream/OSS projects, public competitor products, generic role/team names (e.g. PSAP, Platform/Monitoring), RHAIRFE/RHAISTRAT ticket keys, and public GitHub/docs URLs.
