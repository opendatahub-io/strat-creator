# strat-creator

Takes approved RFEs, which describe the WHAT and WHY, and produces the HOW: actionable implementation strategies grounded in real platform architecture. The pipeline checks technical feasibility against architecture context and scores every strategy so the team knows what's ready and what needs attention.

## What This Does

Given an approved RFE (from the `rfe-creator` pipeline), this pipeline:

1. **Creates** a strategy stub from the RFE data (`strategy-create`)
2. **Refines** the stub into a structured strategy using architecture context (`strategy-refine`)
3. **Reviews** the strategy across 4 dimensions — feasibility, testability, scope, architecture (`strategy-review`)
4. **Human sign-off** — a staff engineer or architect reviews the approved strategy and marks it feature-ready (`strategy-signoff`)

Steps 1–3 run in CI. Step 4 is a human workflow using a separate `local/` workspace.

## Workflows

### CI Pipeline (automated)

The CI pipeline runs `strategy-create` → `strategy-refine` → `strategy-review` in sequence. Each step runs in its own Claude session with artifacts on disk as the handoff. Output lands in `artifacts/`.

Strategies that score **6+ total (no zeros)** get `strat-creator-rubric-pass`. Everything else gets `strat-creator-needs-attention` and waits for a human.

### Human Review (local)

After CI finishes, humans use a separate `local/` workspace to review and iterate without interfering with CI:

```
/strategy-pull RHAISTRAT-1520     # Pull post-CI strategy into local/
/strategy-refine                  # Iterate locally (reads from local/, skips Jira writes)
/strategy-review                  # Re-score locally
/strategy-push RHAISTRAT-1520    # Resubmit needs-attention strategies to CI
/strategy-signoff RHAISTRAT-1520  # Sign off rubric-pass strategies as feature-ready
```

**Two paths depending on CI verdict:**

| CI Verdict | Label | Human Workflow |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| Approved | `strat-creator-rubric-pass` | pull → review locally → `/strategy-signoff` |
| Needs attention | `strat-creator-needs-attention` | pull → fix inputs → refine/review locally → `/strategy-push` → wait for CI → `/strategy-signoff` |

The `strategy-refine` and `strategy-review` skills auto-detect local mode when files are in `local/` — they skip Jira writes and the pipeline label gate.

See [Human Review Guide](docs/human-review-guide.md) for the full walkthrough.

## RFE Discovery and Filtering

The pipeline supports two modes for selecting which RFEs to process:

1. **JQL mode** (`--jql-default` or `--jql`): Queries Jira directly using labels and statuses defined in `config/pipeline-settings.yaml`. Handles batching and pre-filtering automatically.
2. **Config file mode** (`--config`): Reads RFE IDs from a manually curated YAML batch file.

### JQL Pre-Filtering

In JQL mode, RFEs go through a two-stage filter before reaching the skills:

**Stage 1 — Jira-side (JQL query):**
- Must be in `RHAIRFE` project
- Must have `strat-creator-3.5` label
- Must have at least one quality label (`rfe-creator-autofix-rubric-pass` or `tech-reviewed`)
- Must NOT be in `Closed`, `Resolved`, or `Draft` status
- Ordered by `key ASC` for deterministic batching

**Stage 2 — Pre-filter (before batching):**
Queries RHAISTRAT to find RFEs that already have processed or active strategies, then removes them so batch slots aren't wasted. An RFE is excluded if any of its STRATs (via Cloners links):
- Have a skip label: `strat-creator-rubric-pass` or `strat-creator-needs-attention`
- Are in an active/completed status: `In Progress`, `Review`, `Refinement`, `Release Pending`, `Closed`, `Resolved`

After both stages, the first `batch_size` (default 10) remaining RFEs are selected.

### Known Pre-Filter Gaps

The pre-filter is conservative but not perfectly aligned with skill-level gates:

| Scenario | Pre-filter | Skill | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Multiple open STRATs (both New) | Passes | Skips | Wastes a batch slot (rare — 1-2 known cases) |
| Mixed-status STRATs (one Closed + one New) | Excludes | Would import New one | Under-processes (safe direction) |
| Just-created STRAT, not yet refined | Passes | Re-imports (idempotent) | Only if pipeline crashes mid-run |

Use `--include-processed` to bypass pre-filtering when needed.

### Configuration

All filter parameters are externalized in `config/pipeline-settings.yaml` — no hardcoded labels in code.

```bash
# List all matching RFEs
python3 scripts/list-rfe-ids.py --jql-default

# First batch of 10
python3 scripts/list-rfe-ids.py --jql-default --batch-size 10

# Next batch of 10
python3 scripts/list-rfe-ids.py --jql-default --batch-size 10 --batch-offset 10

# Raw JQL override
python3 scripts/list-rfe-ids.py --jql 'project = RHAIRFE AND labels = "strat-creator-3.5"'

# Config file mode (legacy)
python3 scripts/list-rfe-ids.py --config config/road-to-production/batch-07.yaml
```

## Development

### Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# By category
make test-unit          # Unit tests (schemas, frontmatter, scores, JQL, state)
make test-integration   # Integration tests (jira-emulator)
make test-e2e           # E2E pipeline replay (two scenarios)
make test-mermaid       # Mermaid workflow diagram validation

# Or directly via pytest
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

Integration and E2E tests use [jira-emulator](https://github.com/jctanner/jira-emulator) — a real HTTP server started in-process — so no external Jira instance is needed.

### CI

Tests run automatically on PRs and pushes to `main` via GitHub Actions (Python 3.11 + 3.12 matrix). See `.github/workflows/tests.yml`.
