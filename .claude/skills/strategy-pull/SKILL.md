You are pulling a strategy from Jira into the local workspace so a human can review and iterate on it.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` must contain a RHAISTRAT key (e.g., `RHAISTRAT-1520`). If no key is provided, ask the user for one.

## Pull the Strategy

Run the pull script:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/pull_strategy.py $ARGUMENTS
```

This will:
1. Validate the strategy has a post-CI label (`strat-creator-rubric-pass` or `strat-creator-needs-attention`)
2. Fetch the strategy description from Jira
3. Write `local/strat-tasks/RHAISTRAT-NNNN.md` with `workflow: local` frontmatter
4. Fetch the linked RFE original and comments into `local/strat-originals/`
5. Fetch the review summary comment and full review attachment into `local/strat-reviews/`

The pull creates three folders under `local/`:

- **`strat-tasks/`** — The strategy document itself (e.g., `RHAISTRAT-133.md`). This is what you review and edit.
- **`strat-originals/`** — The source RFE snapshot and its comments at pull time. Read-only context for understanding the business need.
- **`strat-reviews/`** — CI review output. Contains two files per strategy:
  - `RHAISTRAT-NNNN-review-summary.md` — The scoring table and verdict (pass/fail, scores per criterion).
  - `RHAISTRAT-NNNN-review.md` — The full prose review from independent reviewers (detailed analysis per dimension).

If the script exits with code 1 (missing labels or not found), explain that only post-CI strategies can be pulled. If code 2 (missing credentials), tell the user to set `JIRA_SERVER`, `JIRA_USER`, and `JIRA_TOKEN`.

## After Pulling

Read the pulled strategy file and the review file (if present). Summarize for the user:

1. **Strategy title and priority**
2. **CI verdict**: approved (rubric-pass) or needs attention
3. **Review highlights**: if a review file was pulled, summarize the key findings
4. **Source RFE**: which RFE this strategy is derived from

Then advise the user on next steps:

- **If rubric-pass**: "The strategy passed CI review. Run `/strategy-refine` and `/strategy-review` to iterate locally, then `/strategy-signoff` when you're satisfied."
- **If needs-attention**: "The strategy was flagged by CI. Run `/strategy-refine` and `/strategy-review` to fix issues locally, then `/strategy-push` to resubmit to CI."

## Prototype Suggestion

After summarizing, scan the pulled strategy and RFE original for UI-related keywords: dashboard, user interface, UI, GUI, visualization, page, screen, form, modal, dialog, navigation, wizard, frontend, web console, monitoring view, configuration page, workflow editor.

If any UI indicators are found, append to your summary: "This strategy appears to involve a user interface. You can generate a clickable prototype to visualize the proposed experience: `/strategy-prototype RHAISTRAT-NNNN`"

If no UI indicators are found, say nothing — do not mention prototyping for non-UI strategies.
